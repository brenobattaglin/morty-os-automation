## macOS

On macOS, Xcode command line tools are required.
You can install them by running:

            xcode-select --install

Also, add the application you're running the script from.

            Settings -> Security & Privacy -> Privacy tab -> Accessibility -> Add...

For example, if you want to execute your node script in e.g. iTerm2, you'd have to add iTerm.app to the list.
