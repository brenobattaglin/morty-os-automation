Morty's here to help me on my daily routine by doing repetitive tasks I do everyday. Thanks Morty.

## macOS

On macOS, Xcode command line tools are required.
You can install them by running:

            xcode-select --install

Also, add the application you're running the script from.

            Settings -> Security & Privacy -> Privacy tab -> Accessibility -> Add...

For example, if you want to execute your node script in e.g. iTerm2, you'd have to add iTerm.app to the list.

## Setup

1. Run **npm i**.
2. Make sure you're logged in on [these urls](https://github.com/brenobattaglin/morty-os-automator/blob/main/src/constants/url.js) so the scripts can work properly.

## How to use

Run _npm run start_ on the terminal and select the option that best suits you.
